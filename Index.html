        <p><b> Fiona Apple McAfee-Maggart </b>(born September 13, 1977) is an <b> American singer-songwriter</b> . She
            has released five albums from 1996 to 2020, which have all reached the top 20 on the U.S. Billboard 200
            chart.Apple has received numerous awards and nominations, including three Grammy Awards, two MTV Video Music
            Awards, and a Billboard Music Award.Classically trained on piano as a child, Apple began composing her own
            songs when she was eight years old. Her debut album, Tidal, written when Apple was seventeen, was released
            in 1996 and received a Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance for the single "Criminal". She
            followed with When the Pawn... (1999), produced by Jon Brion, which was also critically and commercially
            successful and went certified platinum.</p>
        <p>For her third album, Extraordinary Machine (2005), Apple again collaborated with Brion, and began recording
            the album in 2002. However, Apple was reportedly unhappy with the production and opted not to release the
            record, leading fans to erroneously protest Epic Records, believing that the label was withholding its
            release. The album was eventually re-produced without Brion and released in October 2005 to critical
            acclaim. She released her fourth studio album, The Idler Wheel..., in 2012, which was followed by an
            extensive tour of the USA. The album received universal praise</p>
