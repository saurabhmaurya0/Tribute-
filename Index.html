        <div class="child2">
            <b> Fiona Apple McAfee-Maggart </b>(born September 13, 1977) is an <b> American singer-songwriter</b>.
            She has released five albums from 1996 to 2020, which have all reached the top 20 on the U.S. Billboard 200
            chart.Apple has received numerous awards and nominations, including three Grammy Awards, two MTV Video
            Music Awards, and a Billboard Music Award.Classically trained on piano as a child, Apple began composing her
            own
            songs when she was eight years old. Her debut album, Tidal, written when Apple was seventeen, was released
            in 1996 and received a Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance for the single "Criminal". She
            followed with When the Pawn... (1999), produced by Jon Brion, which was also critically and commercially
            successful and went certified platinum.
            The scientist did not wish to make money from his invention and so did not go on to privatise the program.
            Instead, he wanted it to be used to expand the potential of the web as a channel for free expression and
            collaboration.
            <p>For her third album, Extraordinary Machine (2005), Apple again collaborated with Brion, and began
                recording
                the album in 2002. However, Apple was reportedly unhappy with the production and opted not to release
                the
                record, leading fans to erroneously protest Epic Records, believing that the label was withholding its
                release. The album was eventually re-produced without Brion and released in October 2005 to critical
                acclaim. She released her fourth studio album, The Idler Wheel..., in 2012, which was followed by an
                extensive tour of the USA. The album received universal praise.</p>

            <ul>
                Fiona Apple’s music has been suddenly scrubbed from TikTok — fans are primarily pleased.
                Fans across TikTok have discovered that nearly all Fiona Apple’s discography has been removed from the
                platform. Currently, a few of the only songs available from the artist for official use on the app are
                her covers of other artists’ songs — The Beatles‘ “Across the Universe” and the Christmas classic
                “Frosty the Snowman.” Interestingly, some fans have taken to social media to commend Apple for removing
                her music from the app. Some of the singer’s music had been used extensively by TikTok users to “lean
                into the aesthetic of the manic, sad girl,” which Apple herself has often been labeled and reduced to
                throughout her career.
